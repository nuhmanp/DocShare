# TechMuzz Blog using CakePHP

I have created CMS(content management system) using [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) 3.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Use

1. Download [Database](https://github.com/kheniparth/TechMuzz/blob/master/database.sql).
2. Import `sql` file to `phpmyadmin`.
3. Two Users with `(username => password)`as `(admin => 1234)` and `(parth => 1234)` and few posts with comments will be created through that sql file.
